Methods: Multicenter, prospective, controlled and randomized study of patients with rectal       adenocarcinoma with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, who will be randomized into two groups       depending on the approach of the inferior mesenteric vessels. The main variable is pre and       postoperative sexual dysfunction. The sample to be included will be 90 patients, 45 per       group.     "

Up to 50% of sexual dysfunction is described after TME and up to       30% of urinary dysfunction. Although there are other factors, the main cause of postoperative       genitourinary dysfunction is intraoperative injury of the autonomic pelvic nerves. One of the       regions with more risk is the Inferior Mesenteric Artery (IMA). The main objective of the       study is to compare pre- and post-TME sexual dysfunction according to the approach of the       inferior mesenteric vessels, directly on the IMA or from the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV)       to the IMA.

The secondary variables are visualization and preservation       of the pelvic autonomic nerves, pre- and postoperative urinary dysfunction, pre and       postoperative quality of life.
