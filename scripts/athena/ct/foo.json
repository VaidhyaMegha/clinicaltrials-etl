It is composed of 30 items that address general physical symptoms, physical functioning, fatigue and malaise, and social and emotional functioning. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher scores on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A 10 point change in the scoring is considered to be a meaningful change in HRQoL."

The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). The VAS rating scale is a vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale with the end points labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom having numeric values of 100 and 0 respectively. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions."
