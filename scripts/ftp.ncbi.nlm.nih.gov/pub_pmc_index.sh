Hi Dr. Naresh,

Good evening.

My Name is Sandeep Kunkunuru, sorry to drop in a connection request without a note, it seems that we have several
common contacts - Jeevan Rego and Dr. Jyothsna Mandarapu my sister-in-law who also works at Continental Hospitals.

I work at ERT - https://www.ert.com/  who provide devices/services for clinicaltrials globally.
I am planning to move back to India in April and start my own venture on clinicaltrials/healthcare data esp. open data sets. This work is in early stage.
I wanted to seek your time/advice in this regards.

If its feasible for you would love to meet you in person in April.

Thanks for accepting the connection request.

Regards,
Sandeep
